# Customer-Segmentation
Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering
Customer segmentation is a technique used by businesses to divide their customers into distinct groups based on shared characteristics. The K-Means clustering algorithm is a popular unsupervised machine learning method used for this purpose.

How K-Means Works for Customer Segmentation
Data Collection: Gather customer data such as age, income, purchasing behavior, spending score, and other relevant features.

Preprocessing: Normalize or scale the data to ensure equal importance of all features.

Choosing K (Number of Clusters): Use methods like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters.

Cluster Assignment: The algorithm randomly initializes cluster centroids and iteratively assigns customers to the nearest centroid.

Centroid Update: The algorithm updates cluster centers based on the average position of assigned customers.

Convergence: Steps 4 and 5 repeat until clusters no longer change significantly.

Applications of Customer Segmentation

Marketing Personalization: Tailor promotions and recommendations based on customer groups.
Customer Retention: Identify high-value customers and at-risk customers.
Product Development: Design products and services suited for specific customer segments.
Pricing Strategies: Optimize pricing based on customer spending behavi
